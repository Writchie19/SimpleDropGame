## The Game
The game idea is very simple:

Catch raindrops with a bucket.
Bucket located in the lower part of the screen
Raindrops spawn randomly at the top of the screen every second and accelerate downwards.
Player can drag the bucket horizontally via the mouse/touch or move it via the left and right cursor keys.
The game has no end, think of it as a zen-like experience :)
